## ADR-001: One project = one Kata microVM

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** styrman runs AI agents with broad permissions plus Docker-in-Docker per
project. The predecessor `devbox` used Kata (runtime `mvm`) per *user*; an initial
proposal to downgrade to plain runc was rejected by the operator — isolation is the point.

**Decision:** Every project container runs under Kata (`mvm`): own guest kernel,
`CapAdd: SYS_ADMIN, NET_ADMIN, NET_RAW` (not `--privileged`, which breaks Kata device
hotplug), `apparmor=unconfined`, explicit DNS (Kata lacks Docker's embedded DNS),
per-project bridge network. Config ported from devbox `internal/orchestrator/manager.go`.

**Consequences:** Hard blast-radius containment between projects; safe nested dockerd.
Costs: microVM cold-start latency (spike S5), virtiofs for the shared home (S2/S3).

## ADR-002: Terminal transport via Docker exec, no in-container server

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (pending spike S1)

**Context:** devbox ran a shell-server binary inside each container (HTTP+WS on :38917),
which couples server updates to image rebuilds.

**Decision:** Project microVMs run no server. The styrman server uses Docker
`ContainerExecCreate` (TTY) to run `tmux new -A -s conv-<id> <agent>` and bridges the
stream to the browser WebSocket, reusing devbox's wire protocol (binary = PTY bytes,
JSON text = resize, close 4000 = shell exited, 4001 = replaced by newer connection).

**Consequences:** Runtime image is pure tooling; orchestration logic updates centrally.
Fallback if exec streaming under Kata disappoints (S1): port devbox's shell-server.

## ADR-003: Single shared persistent home across all microVMs

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (pending spikes S2/S3)

**Context:** Core operator requirement: configure ssh/agent/cloud credentials once, ever.
devbox proved host-bind-mounted homes (its ADR-012), but 1:1 home:container.

**Decision:** `/var/lib/styrman/home` is virtiofs-mounted as `/home/<user>` in every
project microVM. Workspaces live at `~/projects/<name>`; per-daemon state is
project-scoped (`~/.dockerd/<name>`). Write discipline: a project writes only its own
workspace + dockerd dir; shared-home writes are human-driven.

**Consequences:** Credentials and the agent harness deploy once to the home, not per
image/container. Risk: concurrent virtiofs writers (S2); dockerd overlay2 on virtiofs
(S3) — fallback is per-project named volumes for `~/.dockerd`.

## ADR-004: Per-project Docker-in-Docker

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Sharing the host `docker.sock` would let any project see/kill any other
project's containers — and styrman's own. Rejected by the operator: everything separated.

**Decision:** Each microVM runs its own `dockerd` (devbox entrypoint pattern: cgroup v2
nesting, loop devices, `data-root` in the home under a per-project path).

**Consequences:** Full Docker isolation per project; image caches are per-project
(accepted disk cost). Safe only because of ADR-001.

## ADR-005: Terminal-first — no embedded IDE

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Both predecessors embedded code-server; the operator explicitly wants it
gone. The Antigravity 2.0 conversation-centric layout is the UI model.

**Decision:** The agent CLI in a terminal is the interface. UI = project/conversation
sidebar + terminal panes. Ceiling for file UX is a lightweight viewer/editor pane
(Phase 4). REQUIREMENTS.md R4 makes this non-negotiable to resist scope creep.

## ADR-006: Frontend is a TanStack Start SPA embedded in the Go binary

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Predecessor UIs were no-build vanilla JS (devbox's a 1,187-line monolith
whose own TODO called for a refactor). Global stack standard is TanStack Start + TS +
Tailwind.

**Decision:** `web/` contains a TanStack Start SPA (static export, no SSR), embedded via
`go:embed`; xterm.js vendored locally. The server stays a single deployable binary.

---

## ADR-007: State from labels + filesystem, no database

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** devbox proved label-based adoption (`RecoverState`) across restarts.

**Decision:** Containers carry `styrman.*` labels; conversations are discovered from
tmux; the only file is `projects.json` (atomic tmp+rename, devbox userstore pattern)
for metadata that must outlive containers (agent choice, created, archived).

**Consequences:** Restart/reboot recovery is adoption, not replay. No migrations. If
requirements ever exceed this (search, history), revisit with SQLite.
