## ADR-001: One project = one Kata microVM

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** styrman runs AI agents with broad permissions plus Docker-in-Docker per
project. The predecessor `devbox` used Kata (runtime `mvm`) per *user*; an initial
proposal to downgrade to plain runc was rejected by the operator — isolation is the point.

**Decision:** Every project container runs under Kata (`mvm`): own guest kernel,
`CapAdd: SYS_ADMIN, NET_ADMIN, NET_RAW` (not `--privileged`, which breaks Kata device
hotplug), `apparmor=unconfined`, explicit DNS (Kata lacks Docker's embedded DNS),
per-project bridge network. Config ported from devbox `internal/orchestrator/manager.go`.

**Consequences:** Hard blast-radius containment between projects; safe nested dockerd.
Costs: microVM cold-start latency (spike S5), virtiofs for the shared home (S2/S3).

## ADR-002: Terminal transport via Docker exec, no in-container server

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (spike S1 passed 2026-08-26)

**Context:** devbox ran a shell-server binary inside each container (HTTP+WS on :38917),
which couples server updates to image rebuilds.

**Decision:** Project microVMs run no server. The styrman server uses Docker
`ContainerExecCreate` (TTY) to run `tmux new -A -s conv-<id> <agent>` and bridges the
stream to the browser WebSocket, reusing devbox's wire protocol (binary = PTY bytes,
JSON text = resize, close 4000 = shell exited, 4001 = replaced by newer connection).

**Consequences:** Runtime image is pure tooling; orchestration logic updates centrally.
Fallback if exec streaming under Kata disappoints (S1): port devbox's shell-server.

---

## ADR-003: Single shared persistent home across all microVMs

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (spikes S2/S3 passed 2026-08-26; see ADR-008 for the S3 storage design)

**Context:** Core operator requirement: configure ssh/agent/cloud credentials once, ever.
devbox proved host-bind-mounted homes (its ADR-012), but 1:1 home:container.

**Decision:** `/var/lib/styrman/home` is virtiofs-mounted as `/home/<user>` in every
project microVM. Workspaces live at `~/projects/<name>`; per-daemon state is
project-scoped (`~/.dockerd/<name>`). Write discipline: a project writes only its own
workspace + dockerd dir; shared-home writes are human-driven.

**Consequences:** Credentials and the agent harness deploy once to the home, not per
image/container. Risk: concurrent virtiofs writers (S2); dockerd overlay2 on virtiofs
(S3) — fallback is per-project named volumes for `~/.dockerd`.

---

## ADR-004: Per-project Docker-in-Docker

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Sharing the host `docker.sock` would let any project see/kill any other
project's containers — and styrman's own. Rejected by the operator: everything separated.

**Decision:** Each microVM runs its own `dockerd` (devbox entrypoint pattern: cgroup v2
nesting, loop devices, `data-root` in the home under a per-project path).

**Consequences:** Full Docker isolation per project; image caches are per-project
(accepted disk cost). Safe only because of ADR-001.

---

## ADR-005: Terminal-first — no embedded IDE

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Both predecessors embedded code-server; the operator explicitly wants it
gone. The Antigravity 2.0 conversation-centric layout is the UI model.

**Decision:** The agent CLI in a terminal is the interface. UI = project/conversation
sidebar + terminal panes. Ceiling for file UX is a lightweight viewer/editor pane
(Phase 4). REQUIREMENTS.md R4 makes this non-negotiable to resist scope creep.

---

## ADR-006: Frontend is a TanStack Start SPA embedded in the Go binary

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** Predecessor UIs were no-build vanilla JS (devbox's a 1,187-line monolith
whose own TODO called for a refactor). Global stack standard is TanStack Start + TS +
Tailwind.

**Decision:** `web/` contains a TanStack Start SPA (static export, no SSR), embedded via
`go:embed`; xterm.js vendored locally. The server stays a single deployable binary.

---

## ADR-007: State from labels + filesystem, no database

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted

**Context:** devbox proved label-based adoption (`RecoverState`) across restarts.

**Decision:** Containers carry `styrman.*` labels; conversations are discovered from
tmux; the only file is `projects.json` (atomic tmp+rename, devbox userstore pattern)
for metadata that must outlive containers (agent choice, created, archived).

**Consequences:** Restart/reboot recovery is adoption, not replay. No migrations. If
requirements ever exceed this (search, history), revisit with SQLite.

---

## ADR-008: Per-project dockerd uses overlay2 on a loop-mounted ext4 image

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (spike S3)

**Context:** overlay2 cannot mount on virtiofs (`invalid argument`); devbox worked
around this with `storage-driver: vfs`, which copies every layer fully (slow, bloated).

**Decision:** Each project's dockerd data-root is a sparse ext4 image at
`~/.dockerd/<project>.img` (default 20 G, configurable), loop-mounted inside the guest
by the entrypoint, with overlay2 on top. Prereqs (verified): remount `/sys/fs/cgroup`
rw + cgroup-v2 nesting, loop-device mknod. `vfs` stays available as a config fallback.

**Consequences:** Real overlay2 performance and bounded per-project Docker disk; the
image file persists on the shared home and travels with backups. Growing an image later
= `truncate` + `resize2fs`.

---

## ADR-009: Host prerequisite — Docker time-namespaces disabled

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (spike S0)

**Context:** Docker ≥ 29.5.0 enables private time namespaces by default
(moby/moby#52326); the Kata ≤ 3.31 guest agent rejects the `time` namespace type →
every `--runtime mvm` container fails with `invalid namespace type`
(kata-containers#13080).

**Decision:** `/etc/docker/daemon.json` MUST carry
`"features": {"time-namespaces": false}` on styrman hosts. Owned by
`deploy/host-setup.sh`; applied manually on this host 2026-08-26 (backup:
`daemon.json.bak-20260826`). Revisit when Kata supports time namespaces.

---

## ADR-010: Reproducible host installation is a first-class deliverable

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (operator requirement)

**Context:** Operator directive: the entire project must be easy to reproduce on
another baremetal machine first, or on a GCP VM. The current host accumulated its
Docker/Kata/gVisor setup from devbox scripts plus manual fixes — that history must not
be load-bearing.

**Decision:** `deploy/host-setup.sh` provisions a styrman host from a fresh Debian 13
(baremetal or GCP VM with nested virt): Docker CE, Kata (runtime `mvm`), daemon.json
(incl. ADR-009 flag), host tuning (KSM/THP, sysctls, nested-KVM modprobe), state dirs,
compose + systemd unit. Idempotent, no reliance on devbox leftovers. This machine gets
re-run through it as validation. GCP VM path requires a machine type with nested
virtualization enabled.

**Consequences:** REQUIREMENTS.md R11. The manual S0 fix becomes code. Disaster
recovery = fresh install + restore `/var/lib/styrman`.

## ADR-011: Conversations are durable agent sessions; tmux is only the live view

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Status:** accepted (design direction for Phase 2; operator feedback)

**Context:** Phase 1 equated "conversation" with a tmux session. Operator
feedback after first use: that model is wrong — you can quit claude/agy inside
one and the "conversation" lives on as a shell; killing tmux loses nothing the
user cares about; and the thing they actually want per conversation is its
**history**, like Antigravity's conversation list.

**Decision:** Redefine for Phase 2:
- A **conversation** is a durable record bound to the agent's own session
  (Claude Code session id under `~/.claude/projects/<dir>/`; agy's equivalent
  under `~/.gemini`), with a title and timestamps, stored per project
  (`conversations.json`, userstore pattern — the one addition to ADR-007).
- Opening a conversation attaches (or recreates) its tmux session; if the
  pane's agent exited or the container was restarted, styrman relaunches the
  agent with its native resume (`claude --resume <id>`; agy equivalent) — so
  history survives everything, which is the actual requirement.
- Plain shells are **terminals**, not conversations (Antigravity's right
  rail); they are ephemeral and unlisted in history.
- Deleting a conversation removes the record + tmux session; the agent's
  transcript files remain in the shared home unless the user purges them.

**Consequences:** Phase 2 UI lists conversation history per project even for
stopped projects. Requires per-agent session-id discovery (claude: parse
`~/.claude/projects`; agy: investigate its session store). Phase 1's
tmux-only conversations remain the transport layer underneath.
